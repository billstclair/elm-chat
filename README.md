# elm-chat

This is a simple chat component, designed to be easy to add to your user interface.

I use a WebSocket interface to feed it input, which you can see in my [Archmage game](https://github.com/billstclair/archmage/).

The [examples directory](examples/) has a simple self-contained UI, with separate text input areas for two chatters. It's live at [gibgoygames.com/elm-chat](https://gibgoygames.com/elm-chat/).
